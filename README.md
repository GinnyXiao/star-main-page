# Welcome to the Sailboat Test Arena （STAr） Project Main Page

## Building this Site
Get [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) first. You'll first need the [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) gem hoster though. [Here's the download page](https://rubygems.org/pages/download). _However_, this pretty much requires you to have a Linux/Mac machine. It's quite iffy on Windows.

Once you have Jekyll up and running, to run your site locally, simply hit `jekyll serve` in a terminal. More Jekyll commands will be listed in their site, or simply enter `jekyll` (with no subcommands) in the terminal.
